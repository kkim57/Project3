My name is Katherine Kim and I am currently a student at Illinois Institute of Technology as an Information Technology Management major hoping to get a job in that field upon graduation. I am 28-years-old and currently live in Hinsdale, IL. My interests include music, computers, video games, art and animation, and writing. My hobbies generally correlate with my interests, such as using HTML and CSS to customize web pages, keeping up with animation and exploring artists, and doing writing projects. I currently own two pets, a pair of gerbil brothers.

  These are my two pets, a pair of gerbils named Mocha and Latte. They are a little under one year old. They're a huge handful and require frequent attention! They're adorable, but a lot of work. It's definitely worth the effort though, and I recommend gerbils as pets for people who don't quite have the time for a dog or a cat and dislike the solitary, hands off nature of hamsters.

  The above video is a fine example of my interests in both animation and music. I've always admired the uniqueness of Gorillaz, their music, their animation, and the story behind them as a "virtual band," a combination that I feel like presents a unique brand of storytelling that can't be found anywhere else.
